## Find the right version

To use Espanso on Linux, you first need to determine whether your system is running a X11 or Wayland desktop environment.
If you are unsure, please open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

> If the above command doesn't output anything, please try [with this method](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/325972).

Now that you know your desktop environment, you're ready to choose the right method in the following section.

## Choosing the right install method

There are multiple installation methods on Linux.
This table summarizes them based on distribution and desktop environment:

| Distribution | X11 | Wayland |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu/Debian | **[DEB package](#deb-x11) (recommended)**, [AppImage](#appimage-x11), [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | **[DEB package](#deb-wayland) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Fedora | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Terra RPM package](#terra-x11), [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Terra RPM package](#terra-wayland), [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Arch/Manjaro | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |
| Other distros | **[AppImage](#appimage-x11) (recommended)**, [Manual compilation](#x11-compile) | [Manual compilation](#wayland-compile) |

We are continously improving the installation process, so expect more user-friendly methods soon.

## Install on X11

### Installing with DEB package (Ubuntu/Debian) {#deb-x11}

Espanso ships with a `.deb` package, making the installation convenient on Debian-based systems.

Start by downloading the package by running the following command inside a terminal:

export const DebX11CodeLink = () => <CodeBlock>wget {getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_X11_DEB_DOWNLOAD_URL")}</CodeBlock>;

<DebX11CodeLink />

:::info Verifying package checksum

If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the Github Releases page you will find the SHA256 hash 
in the file `espanso-debian-x11-amd64-sha256.txt`

:::

You can now install the package using:

```
sudo apt install ./espanso-debian-x11-amd64.deb
```

You can safely ignore any `N: Download is performed unsandboxed as root` note from `apt`.

### Installing with Terra RPM package (Fedora-based) {#terra-x11}

The third party repository [Terra](https://terra.fyralabs.com/) automatically builds an `.rpm` package for the latest Espanso release, making installation on Fedora-based systems easier.

Start by following Terra's instructions on installing their main repository here: https://developer.fyralabs.com/terra/installing

:::info Automatically verified builds

Terra builds all packages automatically using GitHub Actions and signs them before distribution, so installation and upgrades via DNF are always checked for integrity.

You can view the RPM spec files and resulting build artifacts for the packages installed via DNF on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages/blob/frawhide/anda/tools/espanso-x11/espanso-x11.spec) (select the correct branch corresponding to your system version).

:::

After installing the repository, you can install the Espanso using:

```
sudo dnf install espanso-x11
```

:::caution Beta releases

Terra always builds the latest tagged release from Espanso's GitHub, including pre-releases, meaning that beta versions may be included with updates.

:::

<X11AfterInstall />

### Installing with AppImage (all distros) {#appimage-x11}

export const AppImageCodeLink= () => <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
{`# Create the $HOME/opt destination folder
mkdir -p ~/opt
# Download the AppImage inside it
wget -O ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage '${getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_X11_APP_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL")}'
# Make it executable
chmod u+x ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage
# Create the "espanso" command alias
sudo ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage env-path register
`}</CodeBlock>;

To install the Espanso's AppImage, open a terminal and follow these steps:

<AppImageCodeLink/>

<X11AfterInstall />

### Compiling from sources {#x11-compile}

#### Prerequisites

These are the basic tools required to build espanso:

* A recent Rust compiler. You can install it following these instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* A C/C++ compiler. On Linux, you should use the default C/C++ compiler (it's usually GCC).
If you run the command specified in the next step, this will be included automatically.

* Install the required linux packages:
  * On **Ubuntu/Debian** run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential git libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdbus-1-dev libssl-dev libwxgtk3.*-dev`

#### Compiling Espanso

Once you've got all the prerequisites, you can:

```bash
# Clone the Espanso repository
git clone https://github.com/espanso/espanso

cd espanso

# Compile espanso in release mode
# NOTE: this will take a while (~5/15 minutes)
cargo build -p espanso --release --no-default-features --features vendored-tls,modulo
```

At this point, you should have the `espanso` binary available in the `target/release/` directory.

#### Installing Espanso

Once you've compiled Espanso, you can move it into the final location. A good option would be the `/usr/local/bin` folder:

```
sudo mv target/release/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
```

## Install on Wayland

> Wayland support is currently experimental, therefore some features might be missing or not working well yet. 
> Known limitations include:
>
> * If you are using a non-us keyboard layout, you'll need to explicitly specify it in the settings (more on this below).
> * There is currently no support for App-specific configurations, which means we can't use patches
> (which are often necessary to support some terminals).
> * If you are using Gnome, Espanso causes a small "flicker" when using the clipboard backend. This does not happen
> on Sway.
> * If you connect a new keyboard, you will need to manually restart Espanso with `espanso restart`, otherwise
> Espanso won't detect it.
>
> If you encounter a bug, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/espanso/espanso/issues),
> any help is greatly appreciated! :)


### Installing with DEB package (Ubuntu/Debian) {#deb-wayland}

Espanso ships with a `.deb` package, making the installation convenient on Debian-based systems.

Start by downloading the package by running the following command inside a terminal:

export const DebWaylandCodeLink = () => <CodeBlock>wget {getStableDownloadLink("LINUX_WAYLAND_DEB_DOWNLOAD_URL")}</CodeBlock>;

<DebWaylandCodeLink />

:::info Verifying package checksum

If you want to verify the correctness of the archive, in the Github Releases page you will find the SHA256 hash 
in the file `espanso-debian-wayland-amd64-sha256.txt`

:::

You can now install the package using:

```
sudo apt install ./espanso-debian-wayland-amd64.deb
```

You can safely ignore any `N: Download is performed unsandboxed as root` note from `apt`.

The process is almost complete, you just need to grant the required capabilities.
